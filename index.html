    <!--I am currently going into my junior year at <a href = "https://www.smuhsd.org/burlingamehigh" target="_blank">Burlingame High School</a> in Burlingame, California. I really enjoy spending time with friends and family and <a href = "https://www.101dogbreeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Yorkie-Jack-Russell-Terrier-Mix.jpg" target= "_blank">my dog Casey.</a> I have an older brother who is a senior at Northwestern University and my older sister is going into Freshman year there too. Unlike them I think I want to go to college in California, but that could change. I really enjoy Math and English and am currently learning computer science. Outside of school I really like to play tennis and other sports for fun to spend time outside. I also really like to listen to music and I like any genre ranging from eighties music to rap. My favorite TV show is <em>The Bachelor </em> and my friend and I even made a fan page for it when we were younger. </center> --->
